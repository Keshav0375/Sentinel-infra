# One-time bootstrap: the three CI identities.
#
# Terraform cannot create the identity its own pipeline authenticates as, so
# these live in rg-sentinel-bootstrap beside the state account — same trust root,
# same reason.
#
# ── Why THREE and not one ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Dynamic deployments create their own resource groups and destroy must purge
# Key Vaults. Neither is possible with rights scoped to one resource group, so
# CI needs SUBSCRIPTION scope. That reverses R5.
#
# R5's reasoning still holds: the credential is reachable from `pull_request`
# workflows on a PUBLIC repo. R5 answered by narrowing the scope; under a dynamic
# model the scope cannot be narrowed, so the answer moves from SCOPE to
# REACHABILITY.
#
#   gha-plan    Reader + blob READER      pull_request, environment:plan
#   gha-deploy  Contributor + RBAC Admin  environment:production, environment:destroy
#   gha-ops     custom start/stop role    environment:ops
#
# A job declaring `environment: X` gets the OIDC subject
# `repo:<owner>/<repo>:environment:X` instead of the branch form, and GitHub will
# NOT mint that for a pull_request event. gha-deploy is therefore unreachable
# from a PR BY CONSTRUCTION — there is no rule to misconfigure. Same mechanism
# that failed phase 4's first apply, used deliberately.
#
# ── gha-plan gets blob READER, not Contributor ───────────────────────────────
# `terraform plan` normally takes a state lock, which is a blob WRITE. Granting
# that leaves the "read-only" identity able to corrupt state — nearly harmless is
# not the same as harmless. So plan runs `-lock=false` and this identity holds
# Storage Blob Data Reader, giving it NO write action anywhere in the
# subscription: a property that can be tested rather than asserted.
#
# The cost, stated: an unlocked plan racing a concurrent apply can read state
# mid-write and produce a stale plan. Acceptable — a plan is advisory, apply
# takes its own lock, and applies are dispatch-only. Not acceptable for apply.
#
# Idempotent. Requires: az, Owner on the subscription, and bootstrap-state.sh.

==> Identities ready. Set these as GitHub repository VARIABLES — not secrets.

==> STILL MANUAL — the identity tenant (R4).

    sentinel-tf-identity needs federated credentials for the same environment
    subjects, because the azuread provider authenticates separately there. The
    two-tenant split doubles the credential surface; phase 4 learned this when a
    PR plan completed the entire azurerm refresh and then died on the azuread
    client, with an error naming the subject but not the tenant.

      needed:     environment:plan, environment:production, environment:destroy
      NOT needed: environment:ops - pause/resume never runs Terraform
