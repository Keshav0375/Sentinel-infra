# ── Why a script and not steps in the workflow ───────────────────────────────
# Same three reasons pause.sh was extracted: the gate's shellcheck glob covers
# scripts/*.sh, a two-hundred-line `run:` block is not reviewable, and this runs
# locally where a workflow step does not. The last one matters most here — a
# teardown you can only trigger through a web form is a teardown you cannot
# rehearse.
#
# ── Ordering is the safety property, and it is asymmetric ────────────────────
# A deployment reads the platform through `terraform_remote_state`, puts a
# namespace on its cluster and a database on its Postgres server. So:
#
#     apply    platform FIRST, then deployments   (dependency before dependent)
#     destroy  deployments FIRST, then platform   (dependent before dependency)
#
# Destroying the platform while a deployment still exists does not fail loudly.
# It leaves an orphaned state file describing resources that no longer exist,
# and the next plan against it reports a create for an estate half of which is
# already gone. That is the failure this ordering prevents.
#
# ── Trust nothing, verify separately ─────────────────────────────────────────
# `terraform destroy` exiting 0 means "everything Terraform KNEW ABOUT is gone".
# It says nothing about resources dropped from state by a failed apply. On
# 2026-08-30 an entire deployment — a resource group, a Key Vault, and a
# database on the SHARED Postgres server — was found alive because a destroy had
# never completed and nothing checked. verify-estate.sh is the answer to that,
# and it queries Azure rather than state.
