# ── Why this exists at all ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `terraform destroy` exiting 0 proves one thing: everything Terraform had in
# state is gone. It cannot speak for a resource dropped from state by a failed
# apply, created outside Terraform, or left behind because the run died between
# the delete and the state write.
#
# On 2026-08-30 the subscription held rg-demo1-dev-cc, a Key Vault, and a
# database on the SHARED Postgres server, five days after that deployment was
# believed destroyed. Every exit code involved was 0. The gap was that nothing
# ever asked Azure.
#
# So this is the referee, and it is deliberately NOT written in Terraform: a
# check that reads the same state it is checking proves nothing.
#
# ── The contract for `--scope all --mode destroyed` ──────────────────────────
# The subscription contains rg-sentinel-bootstrap and NetworkWatcherRG, and
# nothing else. That is the whole "not a single penny" requirement expressed as
# an assertion rather than a hope. Both survivors are $0:
#
#   rg-sentinel-bootstrap  Terraform state (~4 KB) + the three OIDC identities.
#                          Managed identities are free. Delete this and CI can
#                          no longer authenticate to rebuild anything.
#   NetworkWatcherRG       Azure creates it per region automatically and will
#                          recreate it if deleted. The resource is free; only
#                          its features (flow logs, packet capture) bill, and
#                          none are configured.
