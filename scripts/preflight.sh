# Preflight — the checks a `terraform plan` structurally cannot make.
#
# A plan proves auth works, state is readable, config is valid, and what would
# change. It does NOT prove an apply will succeed. Every check below maps to a
# failure this project actually hit, and none of them are visible to a plan:
#
#   quota            the 6-vCPU regional ceiling
#   SKU availability B2ats_v2 failed the system-pool RAM floor; B2s was not in
#                    this subscription's allowed AKS list for canadacentral
#   providers        ten had to be registered by hand on a fresh subscription
#   name availability `sentineltfstate` was already taken by another tenant
#   soft-deleted vault a destroyed vault holds its name for 7 days
#   postgres state   `400 ServerStoppedError` broke a run three times
#   App Service F1   `Current Limit (F1 VMs): 0` killed an apply 14 minutes in,
#                    after the whole platform had already been built
#
# ── Two modes, because the identities differ ─────────────────────────────────
# `plan`  runs under gha-plan (Reader). It gets the checks Reader can perform.
# `apply` runs under gha-deploy. Name availability is a POST `*/action` that
#         Reader cannot call at all, so those checks live here.
#
# The alternative was widening gha-plan so one script could do everything. That
# was rejected: an identity any pull request can trigger should not gain actions
# to satisfy a checklist.
#
# A check that says "no" without saying "run this" has moved the problem rather
# than solved it, so every failure prints its remedy.
#
# Usage: preflight.sh --mode plan|apply [--deployment <d>] [--environment <e>]

  # ── App Service F1 quota, by live probe ───────────────────────────────────
  # On 2026-08-30 an apply ran for fourteen minutes, built the entire platform,
  # and then died on:
  #
  #   creating App Service Plan ... 401 Unauthorized
  #   "Operation cannot be completed without additional quota.
  #    Current Limit (F1 VMs): 0  Current Usage: 0  Amount required: 1"
  #
  # This is a quota refusal wearing a 401, and nothing above catches it: the
  # vCPU check reads Microsoft.Compute cores, and F1 is a Microsoft.Web counter
  # that shares none of that budget.
  #
  # There is no read-only way to ask. Three were tried and all three lie:
  #   Microsoft.Web/locations/<loc>/usages      -> 501 MethodNotAllowed
  #   Microsoft.Web/.../validate (serverfarms)  -> {"status":"Success"} at limit 0
  #   az appservice list-locations --sku F1     -> lists the region regardless
  #
  # So the check is the operation. Create a Free plan, read the answer, delete
  # it. It costs ~20 seconds against fourteen minutes and a half-built estate,
  # and F1 is free, so a probe that briefly exists is billed nothing.
  #
  # ── The probe's own failure mode, and the mitigation ──────────────────────
  # A leaked probe would consume the single F1 slot it exists to protect —
  # turning the check into the outage. Two defences: the name is FIXED, not
  # random, so a leak is findable and self-healing (the next run deletes it
  # before creating); and the delete also runs from an EXIT trap, so a runner
  # cancellation still cleans up. Apply-mode only — gha-plan holds no write
  # action and would fail this on RBAC rather than on quota, which would be a
  # false alarm of exactly the kind this file is trying to end.
