"""Event Grid -> GitHub repository_dispatch bridge (architecture/infra.md §3.5).

The ONLY thing this function does is classify and forward. It never mutates
Azure, GitHub state, or the incident itself — HITL demands that GitHub Actions
is the executor and this stays a messenger (fire-and-forget).

Classification is the two-signal contract (§3.4): a Datadog event tagged
`deploy_status:failed` is a failed deploy (Case 2 — revert PR path); anything
else on this topic is a runtime error (Case 3 — full incident response). The
backend branches on `signal_type`, so this field is load-bearing.

stdlib-only HTTP (urllib) — keeps the remote build trivial and the dependency
surface at exactly one package (azure-functions, for the trigger binding).
