# Terraform creates the VAULT and the ACCESS, never the SECRET VALUES. There is
# deliberately not a single `azurerm_key_vault_secret` resource here: a secret
# declared in HCL ends up in plaintext in the state file, and the state file is a
# blob other principals can read. The 9 runtime secrets are seeded out of band
# with `az keyvault secret set` (§10 step 7) and rotated by the rotator Function.
#
# This module is also the FIRST thing in the project that exercises R5 — the
# `Role Based Access Control Administrator` grant on sentinel-rg. Contributor
# cannot create role assignments, so if these ever fail in CI with
# AuthorizationFailed, R5 is the diagnosis, not the module.

  # identity holds nothing there, so `az keyvault purge` 403s from CI. That is
  # why teardown is a local Owner-run procedure rather than a workflow (R6,
  # §7.3), and why omitting the purge fails *later* — on the next apply, when the
  # provider tries to recover the still-reserved name.
  #
  # Accepted cost: a mistaken destroy can be purged for real — tolerable

# Officer = read/write secrets. User = read only. The split matters: only the
# human operator and the rotator Function ever need to WRITE, and the two
# runtime consumers (CI, backend pod) are read-only by construction rather than
# by convention.

# The HUMAN operator who seeds the 9 secrets (§10 step 7).
#
# Deliberately NOT `data.azurerm_client_config.current.object_id`, which the
# architecture originally specified. That resolves to whoever ran `apply`: the
# human locally, but the sentinel-gha UAMI in CI. The assignment would then
# flip-flop on every context switch — and the first CI apply would destroy the
# human's Officer rights, leaving nobody able to run §10 step 7. It would also
# silently hand CI write access that §3.3's access table says it must not have.
#
# An explicit id is stable regardless of who applies.
# Renamed from `terraform_kv_admin` when the principal changed from
# "whoever ran apply" to an explicit id. A `moved` block makes this a state
# rename rather than a destroy-then-create, so there is never a window in which
# nobody holds Officer on the vault.
