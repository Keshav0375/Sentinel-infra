#
# Scale-to-zero is the cost model — via `az aks stop`/`start` on the WHOLE
# cluster (backend §8.5), not nodepool scaling: a system pool cannot go below
# 1 node, and a 1-pool cluster's pool is always a system pool. Found live
# 2026-08-23 (SystemPoolSkuTooLow). Terraform provisions the cluster only — the
# sentinel-backend manifests live in the Sentinel repo and are applied by
# ci_backend_deployment.yml, never from here.
#
# This module also owns the backend pod's WORKLOAD IDENTITY: the UAMI the pod
# runs as, federated to the cluster's OIDC issuer. Creating it here (not in a
# separate module) keeps the issuer→credential edge inside one plan.

    # only lever is size.

  # ── Entra-integrated Kubernetes RBAC ──────────────────────────────────────
  # This is what makes fetching a kubeconfig SAFE, and it is the reason phase 6
  # could give the plan identity cluster access at all.
  #
  # WITHOUT azure_rbac_enabled, the kubeconfig from `listClusterUserCredential`
  # is effectively cluster-wide access. Handing that to gha-plan — the identity
  # any pull request can trigger — would be the same mistake as granting it
  # `listCredentials`, which phase 5 refused for exactly this reason.
  #
  # WITH it, the kubeconfig carries an exec plugin that mints an Entra token for
  # the CALLING identity, and Azure RBAC decides what that token may do:
  #   gha-plan   → AKS RBAC Reader        (list namespaces, change nothing)
  #   gha-deploy → AKS RBAC Cluster Admin (create namespaces)
  #
  # Future hardening, deliberately not done now: `local_account_disabled = true`
  # removes the admin bypass entirely, but locks out recovery if the Entra path
  # breaks. Worth revisiting once the workflows have run for a while.
  # The provider requires either `tenant_id` or `admin_group_object_ids`.
  # admin_group_object_ids is not an option: creating an Entra security group is
  # a directory write, and the school tenant denies those at policy — the same
  # constraint that killed the `sentinel-db-admins` group in phase 2 (B10).
  # So access is governed purely by Azure RBAC role assignments.

# The per-deployment backend identity and its federated credential USED to live
# here (phase 3). They moved to the deployment layer in phase 5: the cluster is
# shared and each deployment gets its own namespace, its own UAMI and its own
# federated subject `system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<sa>`. Binding one
# identity to the cluster module would have made every deployment share it —
# which is precisely the isolation this design exists to provide.
#
# The `gha_aks_user` role assignment also went: gha-deploy now holds
# "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role" at SUBSCRIPTION scope from
# bootstrap-identities.sh, because it must reach a cluster it has not created yet.
