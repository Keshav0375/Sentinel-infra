# Entra-ONLY authentication. There is no administrator password anywhere in this
# module, in state, or in Key Vault — `password_auth_enabled = false` means one
# cannot exist. Every client presents a short-lived Entra access token (audience
# https://ossrdbms-aad.database.windows.net) as the psql password instead.
#
# B1MS + 32 GB storage matches the Azure for Students 12-month free grant exactly
# (750 h/month of Burstable B1MS, 32 GB storage, 32 GB backup). Note the module
# does NOT configure backup — backup_retention_days is left at the Azure default
# of 7 days; the 32 GB is the grant's allowance, not a setting here. Changing the
# SKU or raising storage takes this off the free meter.

# ── Firewall ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Allow-all is deliberate for dev, and safe here for one specific reason
# (§3.2 "Network reach ≠ auth"): password auth is DISABLED on this server, so
# reaching the port gets an attacker nothing without a valid Entra token issued
# to an admin or a pgaadauth-created role. The firewall controls who can *reach*
# the port, not who can *log in*.
#
# Two client classes need reach and neither has a stable IP: GitHub-hosted
# runners (ci_app_deployment records deploys, ci_incident_response fetches
# context) rotate across a wide published range, and the AKS node pool has no
# fixed egress IP without a NAT gateway. Production would use a Private Endpoint
# + VNet integration; that is out of scope for a demo stack and would break the
# GitHub-hosted runners entirely.
#
# LIMIT OF THAT ARGUMENT: it is about who can LOG IN, not about keeping the
# server UP. max_connections on B_Standard_B1ms is 50, and connection slots are
# consumed before authentication completes — so a trivial connection flood from
# anywhere on IPv4 can exhaust them and deny service to the backend pod and every
# CI workflow, without bypassing auth at all. Accepted for a demo stack on a
# burstable SKU; a Private Endpoint is the real fix and is out of scope.
#
# tfsec/tflint will flag this rule. Annotate the finding — never silence it.
