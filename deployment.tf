# The DEPLOYMENT layer — one isolated deployment, built against the platform.
#
# ── Why a read-only remote-state lookup and not variables ────────────────────
# A deployment NEEDS the cluster's OIDC issuer and the registry's login server,
# and must be unable to change either. A data source enforces exactly that.
# Passing them as variables would mean the same values written in two places,
# drifting the first time one is edited.
#
# It also enforces the direction of dependency. Platform does not know its
# deployments exist; deployments cannot write platform state. Destroying a
# deployment therefore CANNOT touch the cluster — not by convention, but because
# its state file contains none of it.
#
# Everything here is `count`-gated on the layer, so the platform workspace plans
# zero of it. Kubernetes resources live in namespace.tf (task 6.2); this file is
# the Azure half.
