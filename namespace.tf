# The deployment's slice of the SHARED cluster.  (task 6.2)
#
# ── Why a namespace and not a cluster ────────────────────────────────────────
# The subscription's regional quota is 6 vCPU and an AKS node is 2, so
# cluster-per-deployment stops at three with no headroom for a second node
# anywhere. A namespace per deployment scales to whatever the cluster's RAM
# holds.
#
# The isolation is not weaker for being logical. Workload identity federates on
#
#     system:serviceaccount:<deployment>-<env>:sentinel-backend
#
# and Entra matches that subject as an exact string with NO wildcard form. A pod
# in one namespace presenting its token cannot obtain another deployment's Key
# Vault or database access — the separation is cryptographic, not a naming
# convention. The Azure half of that pair (the UAMI and its federated credential)
# is in deployment.tf; this file is the Kubernetes half.
#
# ── Why the ResourceQuota is mandatory ───────────────────────────────────────
# With one shared cluster, an unbounded namespace can exhaust the node and take
# every other deployment down with it. The quota is what makes "shared cluster"
# acceptable rather than merely cheap.
#
# The LimitRange beside it is not decoration: a ResourceQuota that sets
# `requests.cpu` REJECTS any pod that does not declare its own requests, with an
# admission error about quota rather than about the manifest. The LimitRange
# supplies defaults so a normal Deployment still schedules.
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Read-only. The cluster belongs to the platform layer and a deployment must be
# unable to change it — which is also why this is a data source rather than
# anything reached through the remote state's outputs.

# ── Provider auth: an Entra token, not a downloaded admin credential ─────────
# Provider blocks cannot be conditional, so every value is `try`-guarded and
# resolves to "" at the platform layer, where no cluster data is read.
#
# `exec` with kubelogin is the whole point of enabling `azure_rbac_enabled` on
# the cluster. The kubeconfig carries no static credential; kubelogin mints an
# Entra token for whichever identity is running, and Azure RBAC decides what that
# token may do — Reader for gha-plan, Cluster Admin for gha-deploy. Without
# azure_rbac_enabled this same kubeconfig would BE cluster-wide access, which is
# why phase 5 refused to hand it to a PR-reachable identity.
#
# ⚠️ kubelogin must be on PATH. GitHub runners do not ship it; the workflows add
# `azure/use-kubelogin@v1`.
