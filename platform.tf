# The PLATFORM layer — what every deployment shares.
#
# One resource group, one registry, ONE cluster, one database server. Built once,
# in its own workspace, and read by every deployment through a read-only
# remote-state lookup.
#
# ── Why one cluster and not one per deployment ───────────────────────────────
# The subscription's regional quota is 6 vCPU and an AKS node is 2. Cluster per
# deployment therefore stops at three, with no headroom for a second node
# anywhere. A namespace per deployment scales to whatever the cluster's RAM
# holds.
#
# The isolation is not weaker for being logical. Workload identity federates on
# `system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<sa>`, and Entra matches that subject as an
# exact string with no wildcard form — so a pod in one namespace cannot obtain a
# token for another's Key Vault. That separation is cryptographic, not a naming
# convention. (The `ResourceQuota` that stops one namespace starving the others
# is a deployment-layer concern; phase 6, task 6.2.)
#
# Everything here is `count`-gated on the layer, so a deployment workspace plans
# ZERO of it.

# there was one permanent estate. Under a model where deployments are created and

# whole thing this phase removes. Only rg-sentinel-bootstrap stays out-of-band,
# because state cannot delete itself.

# Basic is a separate billable meter at roughly $5/month. Cheaper and free are
# different questions on a subsidised subscription — this was got wrong once.

# against the same grant.
#
# Entra-only: `password_auth_enabled = false`. There is no password anywhere in
# this repo and adding one would be a defect, not a convenience. Callers mint a
# token with `az account get-access-token --resource-type oss-rdbms`.
